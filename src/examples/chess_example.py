This example is a partial solution to a past CTF challenge:
- 'Padding Gambit', Snyk Fetch the Flag 2025

After the first stage (see examples/padding_oracle_crack/aiohttp_example.py), the player

would you like to play a game? 1PPPP3/2P1P3/1P3PP1/1PPP1P2/1P3PP1/2PP2P1/2PP1P1P/2P1P2P w - - 0 1
```

This is 'Forsythâ€“Edwards' notation for a chess game position.
Players had to
- parse the notation to build the game state
- observe that the board consists only of empty space and white pawns, and the position is very unusual
- 'chaining' the ranks (rows) of the board together, interpret empty squares as '0' and inhabited squares as '1'
  to build a binary string
- decode the binary string to obtain a plaintext, which could be given to the Node.js server from the first
  stage in exchange for the flag.
